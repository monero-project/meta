# Lightwallet API
This document describes a reference standard specification for the Monero
lightwallet server/client API. Itâ€™s implemented by OpenMonero, MyMonero, and
the official Monero project, and is maintained with the purpose of organizing
and recording the consensus of Monero lightwallet API projects, and to support
alternate implementations.

Modifications to this specification should only be made with consensus of the
projects which participate by implementing the specification.

## Encoding Schemes
### JSON
JSON is the original and required encoding scheme used for the API. Binary
values (public keys, hashes, etc) are sent as an ascii-hex string. Some
integers, that may exceed 2^53, are sent as strings. This is to due to the
limitation within Javascript where all integers are double floating point
values.

## Transport Layers
### HTTP-REST
When calling an API method, the client must use HTTP POST to a path with the
method name. As an example, to invoke the `get_address_txs` method, the client
sends a POST message to `/get_address_txs` where the body contains the JSON
request object associated with that method name. If the requested method does
not exist, a HTTP 404 "Not Found" error must be returned. If the request type
is not POST, the server shall return a HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" error. If
the server is unable to complete a request temporarily due to load, then the
server shall return a HTTP 503 "Service Unavailable" error to indicate to the
client that the request may be serviceable later.

Servers must support the JSON encoding scheme. The client must send the HTTP
field `Content-Type: application/json`; if the server is not provided that
content type from the client then the server shall respond with a HTTP 415
"Unsupported Media Type" error.

This transport layer does not use HTTP authentication, and instead uses the
`view_key` field for authorization. Documentation for a specific method will
indicate whether `view_key` is required. When it is not necessary, anyone can
invoke the method.

## Schema
The ascii name of the field is used as a key in JSON encoding. If a field has
a `*` indicator, that means the field is optional. If `*` is used next to the
type, the value can be "null" or a value valid according to the type.

### Types
**binary**

A hex-ascii string in JSON. This is generally some irreducible cryptographic
concept - a public key or hash.

**base58-address**

A Monero public address encoded as a string in JSON.

### Methods
#### `get_address_info`
Returns the minimal set of information needed to calculate a wallet balance,
including the balance of subaddresses. The server cannot calculate when a spend
occurs without the spend key, so a list of candidate spends is returned.

**Request** object

|   Field   |       Type       |            Description                |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| address   | `base58-address` | Standard address of the wallet        |
| view_key  | `binary`         | View key bytes for authorization      |

> If `address` is not authorized, the server must return a HTTP 403
> "Forbidden" error.

> If `address` is not a standard address, the server must return a HTTP 400
> "Bad Request" error.

**Response** object

|        Field         |          Type            |       Description         |

| total_received       | `uint64-string`          | Sum of received XMR       |
| total_sent           | `uint64-string`          | Sum of possibly spent XMR |
| scanned_height       | `uint64`                 | Current tx scan progress  |
| scanned_block_height | `uint64`                 | Current scan progress     |
| start_height         | `uint64`                 | Start height of response  |
| transaction_height   | `uint64`                 | Total txes sent in Monero |
| blockchain_height    | `uint64`                 | Current blockchain height |
| spent_outputs        | array of `spend` objects | Possible spend info       |
| rates *              | `rates`                  | Current exchange rates    |

> `rates` is omitted if unavailable.

#### `get_address_txs`
Returns information needed to show transaction history. The server cannot
calculate when a spend occurs without the spend key, so a list of candidate
spends is returned. The response should show a wallet's entire history,
including transactions to and from subaddresses.

**Request** object

|   Field  |        Type      |             Description               |

| view_key | `binary`         | View key bytes for authorization      |

> If `address` is not authorized, the server must return a HTTP 403
> "Forbidden" error.

> If `address` is not a standard address, the server must return a HTTP 400
> "Bad Request" error.

**Response** object

|        Field         |             Type               |       Description         |

| transactions         | array of `transaction` objects | Possible spend info       |

#### `get_random_outs`
Selects random outputs to use in a ring signature of a new transaction. If the
`amount` is `0` then the `monerod` RPC `get_output_distribution` should be used
to locally select outputs using a gamma distribution as described in "An
Empirical Analysis of Traceability in the Monero Blockchain". If the `amount`
is not `0`, then the `monerod` RPC `get_output_histogram` should be used to
locally select outputs using a triangular distribution
(`uint64_t dummy_out = histogram.total * sqrt(float64(random_uint53) / float64(2^53))`).

| amounts    | array of `uint64-string` objects | XMR amounts that need mixing     |

> Clients must use amount `0` when computing a ringct output.

> If clients are creating multiple rings with the same amount, they must set
> `count` to the mixin level and add the value to `amounts` multiple times.
> Server must respond to each value in `amounts`, even if the value appears
> multiple times.

| n_maj *   | `uint32`         | Number of major subaddresses to provision       |

> The various combinations of `maj_i`, `min_i`, `n_maj`, and `n_min` behave
> differently, but generally the server provisions subaddresses where it has not
> already provisioned them, with the indexes specified as lower bounds.

> If, for example, only `maj_i` is included, then the server should provision a
> default number of minor subaddresses (e.g. 500) within that `maj_i`, wherever
> minor subaddresses have not already been provisioned, starting with `min_i`
> set to 0 as the lower bound.

> If, for example, `maj_i`, `min_i`, `n_maj` and `n_min` are included, then the
> server should provision `n_maj` majors wherever major subaddresses have not
> already been provisioned starting with `maj_i` as the lower bound, and for
> each major, provision `n_min` subaddresses starting with `min_i` as the lower
> bound.

> All combinations follow the above framework.

> The server can choose to "pad" counts and provision *more* than a client
> requests.

> If the server cannot provision a specified number of subaddresses because the
> server would provision more than the maximum number of subaddresses, HTTP 409
> should be returned. Ack that the status code is not perfect here. In this
> case, the client should make a new request either with a smaller requested
> number of subaddresses to provision, or at a different major or minor index.

> If none of `maj_i`, `min_i`, `n_maj`, and `n_min` are included in the request,
> the server must return a HTTP 400 "Bad Request" error.

> `get_all` defaults to true if not included in the request.

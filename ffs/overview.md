## 1. What is the Forum Funding System?
Monero is an open-sourced, decentralized, community-driven project. There is no 'Monero Foundation' or corporation of any kind behind the movement. This means that most of the development is done by pro bono volunteers, but there are occasions where an idea will require some funding to complete. In these cases, the Forum Funding System (FFS) is used.

**The FFS is a way to crowdfund proposals put together by community members for a specific idea.**

Past proposals have come for many different types and purposes. Some have specific ideas of how to improve an area of the codebase, others look for travel reimbursement when leading a foreign Monero-related event, and still others have made high quality media content for the community.

The idea is that if the community likes an idea and feels it will benefit Monero, they will donate money to make it a reality. If the community does not deem the proposal worth the money or otherwise feel negatively about a proposal as a whole, then they will not fund the project.

## 2. FFS vs Monero General Fund
Both the FFS and the Monero General Fund are ways for anyone to contribute their Monero for the betterment of the project, but there is a difference. As a whole, the Monero General Fund is a stash of Monero and Bitcoin that is managed by the Monero Core Team. It is used to pay server costs, donate to various FFS proposals, and any other circumstances that the Core Team deems worthy of the funds.

If one donates to FFS proposals, he can choose whether or not to support a project based on his thoughts about said project. This gives you more control over where your money goes and helps to shape Monero in the direction you think it needs to set. It basically votes with your wallet.

If one donates to the Monero General Fund, they are releasing their Monero to The Monero Project to be used in any way that might help Monero. The General Fund is commonly used to help fund proposals too, so in many cases donating to the General Fund is donating to FFS proposals, even when there are none available to contribute to.

## 3. Why the FFS exists
The Monero Core Team acts as an escrow between the individual contracted to do the work and the community to ensure nobody gets cheated. The funds are released as key milestones in the project are accomplished.

In the times before the FFS if an individual had an idea that he would like to make for the betterment of the project, he would see if he could get support and donations from individuals to accomplish his task. There have been some major blows as some individuals accepted the Monero upfront and then failed to deliver on their promises, resulting in wasted funds and disgruntled community members. The FFS exists so as to provide a fair and accountable environment in which innovation can thrive.

## 4. The FFS Workflow
A typical FFS proposal goes through the following stages:
1. Idea stage
2. Open Task stage
3. Funding Required stage
4. Work in Progress stage
5. Completed Proposal

We will break down these stages in detail below.

### Idea stage
In the idea stage a member of the community has an idea that they think will benefit the Monero Project. The proposal does not have to be made by the individual who plans to fulfill it.  They write out a draft proposal of the idea and can get feedback from the community and make changes. Once the idea reaches general consensus, it moves to the next stage.

### Open Tasks stage
In this stage, a written proposal waits for a good match to a community member that is capable of getting the task done. In some cases the matching individual is the proposer (i.e. the person who proposes the idea is the same person who plans to complete it). In this case, the individual can skip the Idea stage and put their proposal into the Open Tasks stage for comment by the community. In some cases though, the proposal has no matching individual, and awaits a community member to accept the task as agreed upon by the community. 

Once a match is found, the individual (usually an expert in the field) can set milestones for the project, and make any adjustments that are needed to make the proposal realistic. After a final round of time for the community to comment the proposal moves on to the next stage.

### Funding Required stage
In this stage, a Core Team member sets up a Monero address/payment ID combo into which donations can be given toward the project. It is up to each individual whether or not to donate to support the proposal, and some proposals may await funding for quite some time, while others are funded very quickly. Once the project has reached 100% funding, the proposal moves to the next stage.

*Note: If the proposal is funded more than 100% then the remainder of the donated Monero goes into the General Fund, unless special arrangements have been otherwise made and agreed upon beforehand.*

### Work in Progress stage
The idea has been proposed, an individual has agreed to do it, and the funds have been acquired, all that's left is to do it. In this stage, the individual or team begins working on the project as outlined by the proposal, updating the community as specified in the FFS Terms. After each milestone is complete, the individual or team is to contact a member of the core team for a payout, and the milestone is considered complete. After all of the milestones have been complete, the agreed upon deliverable has been given to the community, and the individual has been paid, the proposal moves to the last stage.

### Completed Proposal
Sit back, put on your party hat, and celebrate. What once started as an idea is now a reality. Things are now finished and the Monero community benefits from yet another completed proposal. This is what makes Monero special. The community believes in the tech and in its members. We did it. Many more proposals to come.

### A note about Expiration
In some rare cases, a proposal is abandoned by the individual or team who has agreed to work on it. In these cases the proposal enters a special 'Expired' state, which is somewhere in between Open Tasks and Work in Progress. The funds have already been raised, but a new individual is needed to take on the project. Usually the community has to accept a new person that will work on the project that they feel would be qualified to do so.

## 5. General FFS Guidelines
*Note: These guidelines are different than the official FFS terms, which are required reading before submitting a proposal. These guidelines are just general ideas for the best way to have a smooth experience with the FFS.*

* Read the Terms. Seriously. Things will not go well if you do not read the Terms and follow them.
* If you are trying to distill community reaction to an idea, it's recommended you come to the appropriate IRC channel for feedback. The people there are usually quite serious about Monero and more than willing to help out.
* If you are an individual who wants to complete some ideas, it helps if the community knows who you are first. While it's possible for newcomers to propose and complete new ideas through the FFS, it's not common. Build a reputation of service to Monero and its community. That usually means doing some work pro-bono, or otherwise proving your qualities and skills.
* When your proposal is in the Funding Required stage, it's fine to let people know about by posting in the various Hangouts. There will be a time however when people know it's around, and if it's still not funded then contuining to talk about it will only annoy others.
* Be willing to amend the proposal pre-Work in Progress. It's not 'your baby', and you may have to make some tweaks in milestones, price, or scope as determined by community feedback. If you're an expert and you feel strongly about keeping something a certain way, make your case in a reasonable manner. The community just wants what's best for Monero, and as the expert, you have to explain to them why your way makes more sense.
* If you've completed a milestone and ping a core team member for a payout, be patient. They have lives to, and aren't paid to work on Monero. That being said, they realize they forget things and don't take offense if you poke them every once in a while to remind them.
* There will be some people that think they are owed the world for cheap and make a lot of demands. Unless these demands are reasonable, you don't have to listen to them. You can charge a fair price, but you should not expect to make your fortune off of the FFS. This is an open source project, after all.

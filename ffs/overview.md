## 1. What is the Forum Funding System?

TL;DR

**The FFS is a way to crowdfund proposals put together by community members for a specific idea.**

Monero is an open-sourced, decentralized, community-driven project. Development is done by volunteers and funding is provided solely by community donations. There is no single entity controlling the direction of Monero; so, the Forum Funding System (FFS) facilitates the funding of volunteers when needed.

Past proposals have come for many different types and purposes. Some have specific ideas of how to improve an area of the codebase, others look for travel reimbursement when leading a foreign Monero-related event, and still others have made high quality media content for the community.

The idea is that if the community likes an idea and feels it will benefit Monero, they will donate money to make it a reality. If the community does not deem the proposal worth the money or otherwise feel negatively about a proposal as a whole, then they will not fund the project.

## 2. FFS vs Monero General Fund
Both the FFS and the Monero General Fund are ways for anyone to contribute their Monero for the betterment of the project, but there is a difference. As a whole, the Monero General Fund is a stash of Monero and Bitcoin that is managed by the Monero Core Team. It is used to pay server costs, donate to various FFS proposals, and any other circumstances that the Core Team deems worthy of the funds.

If one donates to FFS proposals, he can choose whether or not to support a project based on his thoughts about said project. This gives you more control over where your money goes and helps to shape Monero in the direction you think it needs to set. It basically votes with your wallet.

If one donates to the Monero General Fund, they are releasing their Monero to The Monero Project to be used in any way that might help Monero. The General Fund is commonly used to help fund proposals too, so in many cases donating to the General Fund is donating to FFS proposals, even when there are none available to contribute to.

## 3. Why the FFS exists
The Monero Core Team acts as an escrow between the individual contracted to do the work and the community to ensure nobody gets cheated. The funds are released as key milestones in the project are accomplished.

In the times before the FFS if an individual had an idea that he would like to make for the betterment of the project, he would see if he could get support and donations from individuals to accomplish his task. There have been some major blows as some individuals accepted the Monero upfront and then failed to deliver on their promises, resulting in wasted funds and disgruntled community members. The FFS exists so as to provide a fair and accountable environment in which innovation can thrive.

## 4. The FFS Workflow
A typical FFS proposal goes through the following stages:
1. Idea stage
2. Open Task stage
3. Funding Required stage
4. Work in Progress stage
5. Completed Proposal

### Idea stage
In the idea stage, a member of the community has an idea of which they think will benefit the Monero Project. Their idea is then written into a proposal and then submitted to the community in PR form for feedback. After any potential revisions, and once the idea reaches general consensus, the proposal then moves to the next stage in the FFS workflow. Note: the proposal does not have to be written by the individual who plans to fulfill the proposal.

### Open Tasks stage
In this stage, the written proposal waits for someone who is both capable and dedicated to fulfilling the proposal. In some cases, the individual is the proposer (i.e. the person who proposes the idea is the same person who plans to complete it). In some cases though, the proposal has no matching individual, and awaits a community member to accept the task as agreed upon by the community. 

Once a match is found, the person fulfilling the proposal can then set milestones for the proposal and make any adjustments to the proposal as needed. After a final round of time for the community to comment, the proposal moves onto the next stage.

### Funding Required stage
In this stage, a Core Team member sets up a Monero address/payment ID combo into which donations can be given toward the project. It is up to each community member to decide whether or not to donate to the proposal. Some proposals may await funding for quite some time while others are funded very quickly. Once the project has reached 100% funding, the proposal moves to the next stage.

*Note: If the proposal is funded more than 100% then the remainder of the donated Monero goes into the General Fund, unless special arrangements have been otherwise made and agreed upon beforehand.*

### Work in Progress stage
In this stage, the worker(s) who've agreed to complete the work either continue or begin the work as outlined by the proposal (worker(s) do not need to wait for funding to begin work), updating the community as specified in the FFS Terms. After each milestone is finished, the worker(s) must contact a member of the core team for a milestone payout, and then the milestone is considered complete. After all of milestones have been completed, and the worker(s) been paid, the proposal moves to the last stage.

### Completed Proposal
Sit back, put on your party hat, and celebrate. What once started as an idea is now a reality. Things are now finished and the Monero community benefits from yet another completed proposal. This is what makes Monero special. The community believes in the tech and in its members. We did it. Many more proposals to come.

### A note about Expiration
In some rare cases, a proposal is abandoned by the individual or team who has agreed to work on it. In these cases the proposal enters a special 'Expired' state, which is somewhere in between Open Tasks and Work in Progress. The funds have already been raised, but a new individual is needed to take on the project. Usually the community has to accept a new person that will work on the project that they feel would be qualified to do so.

## 5. General FFS Guidelines
*Note: These guidelines are different than the official FFS terms, which are required reading before submitting a proposal. These guidelines are just general ideas for the best way to have a smooth experience with the FFS.*

* Read the Terms.
* If you are trying to distill community reaction to an idea, it's recommended you come to the appropriate IRC channel for feedback. The people there are usually quite serious about Monero and more than willing to help out. The list of common IRC hangouts can be found [here](https://getmonero.org/community/hangouts)
* If you are an individual who wants to complete some ideas, it helps if the community knows who you are first. While it's possible for newcomers to propose and complete new ideas through the FFS, it's not common. Build a reputation of service to Monero and its community. That usually means doing some work pro-bono, or otherwise proving your qualities and skills.
* When your proposal is in the Funding Required stage, it's fine to let people know about by posting in the various [Hangouts](https://getmonero.org/community/hangouts).
* Be willing to amend the proposal pre-Work in Progress. You may have to make some tweaks in milestones, price, or scope as determined by community feedback. If you're an expert and you feel strongly about keeping something a certain way, make your case in a reasonable manner. The community just wants what's best for Monero, and as the expert, you have to explain to them why your way makes more sense.
* If you've completed a milestone and ping a core team member for a payout, be patient. They have lives too, and don't get paid for their Core team work (though they may have active FFS contracts for specific work like anyone else). That being said, they realize they forget things and don't take offense if you poke them every once in a while to remind them.
* Feel free to charge a fair price for your work, we only ask that you remember that this is an open-source community that is run on donations.

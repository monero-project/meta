# Forum Funding System Terms & Conditions

## Introduction
This document is written in order to clearly outline the expectations of the Monero community of a FFS proposal and the individual or team (hereafter 'contractor') that will fulfill it. By submitting a proposal, you agree that you have read and understood these terms, and failure to comply with these terms will lead to an investigation that may lead to the dismissal of the noncompliant individual from the FFS project. These terms are not legally binding, as Monero is not a corporation, but if you do not follow them you there will be many issues with fulfilling the contract and receiving your payments. So if you value your time and wish to be compensated for your work, then following these terms is advised.

Whenever it is mentioned that something will be decided by 'the community' it is understood that this will mean during one of the bi-monthly community meetings. The item must be added to the GitHub agenda/issue ASAP, and if the meeting is less than a week away then the item must be postposned to the next meeting. This is so anyone who wishes to attend the meeting to vote and make their voice heard is given ample opportunity and notice to do so.

If a community member is unnable to attend a meeting but would like to vote on an issue, he/she may do so by proxy by providing permission in writing to the community, specifically naming the individual who may vote on his/her behalf. In the event that a community member does not attend a meeting and does not like the decision that was agreed upon during said meeting, tough. He/she should have been there or voted by proxy.

All votes will be done by a show of hands (o/) for 'yays' and 'nays', the votes will be tallied, the number verified, and the majority shall win the vote. We do not have an electoral college. :P

## Licensing
The completed deliverable must be under an approved open source license. A list of good ones to use can be found [here](https://opensource.org/licenses). Given that this is an open-source community, it is also expected that progress be easily trackable via GitHub and under an open source license during the course of its development.

## Activity Reporting
Once a proposal has been funded, it is required that at the minimum the contractor provide two reports monthly about their progress. This will usually be done during bi-monthly dev or community meetings (whichever is most appropriate for the proposal) in the #monero-dev or #monero-community IRC channels respectively. Because there are usually only two meetings a month, it means that a contractor should aim to attend all meetings so as to meet this criteria. In the case of emergency or other extenuating circumstances, the contractor should arrange to deliver an update via another medium, or by proxy in the meeting. This is to be the exception rather than the rule however, and multiple infringements could lead to an investigation.

Should the contractor wish to provide more updates, this is fine and can be done via reddit, meetings, or the comments section of the Work in Progress proposal.

## Milestone Completion
When a milestone is compelted, the contractor is expected to make an update ON the proposal page itself (meaning having to make a PR request to the website GitHub). This provides accountability for when the update was made and the content that was included. If the PR is not merged and the website rebuilt and uploaded in a timely manner, it is not the fault of the contractor, and the PR is sufficient proof of compliance.

## Ammending Funded Proposals
The contractor understands that by submitting the proposal and getting it funded, they now work for, and are answerable to, the Monero community. It is expected that in your proposal you provide realistic milestones and timings for milestone completions. The community is not composed of experts. Instead the contractor is expected to be the expert and provide accurate estimations. A funded proposals means that the community has agreed to the terms written in the proposal AT THE TIME THE PROPOSAL WAS FUNDED. Once funding reaches 100%, ammending the proposal for any reason will be a community process.

The contractor is expected to proposte to the community the ammended terms as well as the reasons for the change. It is then up to the community whether or not to allow the change or not. If the community deems the changes undesireable, the previous contract holds and it is up to the contractor whether or not he/she wishes to continue the proposal under the old terms.

In the event that the community agrees to the ammends, the contractor must submit a thorough update ON his/her proposal (meaning having to make a PR request to the website GitHub) with the terms that are changed at the bottom, as well as the words 'Proposal Ammended' at the top in bold. This will tell the community that the terms have been ammended and to take special note of the changes at the bottom. If the PR is not merged and the website rebuilt and uploaded in a timely manner, it is not the fault of the contractor, and the PR is sufficient proof of compliance.

## Leaving a Funded Proposal
In the event that a contractor does not wish to complete a proposal for any reason, he/she may bow out of the project. It is requested for sake of polite disclosure that the contractor formally tell the community about his/her leaving, though we respect privacy so details are optional.

In the event that a contractor leaves the proposal, he/she understands that the proposal enters an 'Expired' state as outlined in the FFS Overview and is eligible to be picked up by another contractor for completion. He/she also understands that his/her work up to the point of leaving has been paid for and is therefore unrevocably open-sourced. The contractor may claim any fairly completed milestones after leaving.

## Picking up a Funded Proposal
A second contractor may pick up any proposal that is in an 'Expired' state. He/she must take note of the current terms and notify the community of their interest in picking up the proposal. If there are any adjustments to the proposal that need to be made to fit individual needs or schedules, he/she will bring the ammended terms to the community for review and approval.

In the event that the community agrees to the ammends, the contractor must submit a thorough update ON the proposal (meaning having to make a PR request to the website GitHub) with the terms that are changed at the bottom, as well as the words 'Proposal Ammended / New Contractor' at the top in bold. This will tell the community that the terms have been ammended and to take special note of the changes at the bottom. If the PR is not merged and the website rebuilt and uploaded in a timely manner, it is not the fault of the contractor, and the PR is sufficient proof of compliance.

In the event that the community does not agree to the new terms, the contractor can make further ammends and repeat the process or choose to not pick up the proposal. He/she may, of course, also choose to do the work as he/she pleases without community input, though they cannot formally charge the FFS. In the event that he/she completes the project on his/her own the community may decide to release funds anyway, but there are no guarentees.

## Investigation
In the event that a contractor does not comply with the terms above, a special Monero investigative team will be put together that should include one Core team member (or trusted proxy) and at least one other volunteer. The proposal is considered 'on hold' until investigation is complete. Should work continue and milestones be completed during a time of investigation, no payouts are to be made until the investigation is complete.

The contractor is expected to comply with the investigative team's requests, which may include, but are not limited to, chat logs, proof of work, and other requested materials.

The investigative team is write up their conclusion and present to the community, who can then either provide a formal dismissal or allow the contractor to continue the contract.

## Appeal
In the event that a contract leaves a proposal or is dismissed, but he/she has, in the time that followed, proven their goodwill, they can make an appeal to the community to resume the contract, assuming another contractor hasn't already picked up the proposal. They can provide whatever evidence they think will be helpful in convincing the community to let them resume their previous work.

Should the community decide to allow the contractor to resume his/her work, he/she may begin immediately. Should they decide not to, the contractor is expected not to be a baby about it.

## Conclusion (a note about the community)
This conclusion is in plain terms and in non-official voice, so is not expected to be taken with the weight of the above terms.

We apologize if these terms seem overly strict or harsh. The community of Monero is really a very welcoming and friendly place. We just want to ensure that we have an environment that is fair, encourages innovation, protects the money of contributors, and protects contractors. In other words, we want a [smooth](https://github.com/iamsmooth) FFS experience for everyone, contractors and contributors alike.

We all want Monero to succeed, and we've got an awesome community that can make it happen. Let's just treat each other well, be honest with each other about anything unexpected that may arise, and make reasonable arguments for or against something, and, you know, be adults. In doing so, we shouldn't have any issues.

Hopefully.
